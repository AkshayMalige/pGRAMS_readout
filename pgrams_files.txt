The DriverWizard has created:
* A sample diagnostics application for testing the communication with
  your hardware from the user mode.
* Library files, which include API for controlling your hardware.

  /home/pgrams/WD1630LNX86_64/wizard/my_projects/pgrams/pgrams_installation/redist
         The redistribution package files will reside in this folder

  /home/pgrams/WD1630LNX86_64/wizard/my_projects/pgrams/pgrams_installation/lib
         The library files will reside in this folder

  /home/pgrams/WD1630LNX86_64/wizard/my_projects/pgrams/pgrams_files.txt
         A detailed overview of all the generated files.

  /home/pgrams/WD1630LNX86_64/wizard/my_projects/pgrams/pgrams_lib.h
         A library for controlling your hardware through WinDriver.

  /home/pgrams/WD1630LNX86_64/wizard/my_projects/pgrams/pgrams_lib.c
         Contains the implementation of the functions used for
         accessing each of the resources defined in the Wizard.

  /home/pgrams/WD1630LNX86_64/wizard/my_projects/pgrams/pgrams_diag.c
         The sample user-mode application that diagnoses your
         hardware using the pgrams_lib.c library.

  /home/pgrams/WD1630LNX86_64/wizard/my_projects/pgrams/linux/makefile
         Linux makefile.

Compiling this project:
  For Linux, run  - "make -C linux"

Converting to a GUI application:
  This sample was written as a console mode application (rather than
  a GUI application) that uses standard input and standard output.
  This was done in order to simplify the source code.
